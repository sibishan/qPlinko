## Overview

qPlinko is a quantum themed Plinko style game implemented in Google Colab. This game utilises two quantum supremacy pillars, superposition & entanglement.

## Features

- Interactive Plinko board UI (canvas based)
- Configurable game settings (bet sizing, risk level, board size)
- Optional entangled ball mode
- Payout summary outputs

## Getting Started

1. Open `qPlinko.ipynb` in Google Colab.
2. Run the first setup cells to install dependencies.
3. Run all cells, then use the UI controls to play.

## Requirements

- Google Colab (required for reliable widget rendering)

## How to Play

1. Set your parameters (bet amount, risk level, number of rows, entanglement toggle).
2. Drop a ball (or run multiple drops).
3. Review the landing bin and payout shown.
4. Play until you lose all your money (*haha*).
